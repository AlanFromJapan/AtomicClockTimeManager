# AtomicClockTimeManager
Code to handle the PPS from the atomic clock, RTC and multiple time display for the **[Atomic Clock Revisited](http://electrogeek.tokyo/atomic%20clock%20revisited.html)**.

## Code "branch"
*Mea maxima culpa* is that I have an awfully messy 15 years old repo https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools. It's the kind of thing you know it's bad, but would take so much time and energy to fix you leave as is. There's tens of projects there, barely none worth a dedicated repo.

I wanted to branch the [MultiClockManager](https://github.com/AlanFromJapan/alanarduinotools/tree/master/Atmegaxx8/MultiClockManager) but it'd mean branching the whole repo. So let's make things clean for this present one project, big enough to have its own repo.
